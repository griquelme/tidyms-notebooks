# README

**Warning: Raw data analysis still cannot be performed because the raw data files used in the notebooks are still being uploaded to the Metabolights repository. Despite this, the notebooks with figures still can be used as the data matrix data is part of this repository.**

This directory contains the analysis and figures generated in the publication **Modelling LC-MS data for quality assessment in untargeted metabolomics** (ADD DOI after publiation). THe notebooks are organized as follows:

* `preprocessing.ipynb` contains the code to process raw mzML files into a data matrix.
* `preprocessing-progenesis.ipynb` containst the code to perform data curation on the data matrix from the same dataset obtained with Progenesis QI.
* `figures.ipynb` contains the code to generate the figures used in the publication.
* `supplementary-figures.ipynb` contains the code to generate the figures shown in the supplementary material, using the data matrix obtained with Progenesis QI.
