This repository contains notebooks with applications examples for the TidyMS library.

The directory `tidyms-paper` contains examples for the applications published in the paper **A Python-based pipeline for preprocessing LC-MS data for untargeted metabolomics workflows** (https://doi.org/10.3390/metabo10100416).

The directory `lcms-model` contains the analysis and figures generated in the publication **Modelling LC-MS data for quality assessment in untargeted metabolomics** (ADD DOI after publiation).

Usage
-----

1. Install tidyms using pip:

```shell
pip install tidyms
```

2. Some of the examples use the adjustText package to display text in the plots.
   This package is also available through pip:
